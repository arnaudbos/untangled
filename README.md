# Untangled - Sneak peek at Project Loom

This repository contains code samples I have used to experiment with [Project Loom](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/loom/Main)'s
**continuations** and **lightweight threads**.

I gave [several talks](https://talks.arnaudbos.com/) on this topic, and wrote a series of
[blog posts](https://i-rant.arnaudbos.com/loom-part-0-rationale/) where the code in this repository is
described and profiled to understand what is Project Loom, why it is coming and how it does what it does.

The end.
